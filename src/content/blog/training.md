## 📈 Pitcher’s Ramp-Up Guide (Weekends)

Do not go 100% effort in the first week. Gradually build your arm "gas tank."

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Saturdays focus on **Long Toss**. Keep a high arc. Max distance 120 feet.
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Add **Flat Ground** sessions on Wednesdays. Throw your arsenal (Fastball/Changeup) on flat ground to work on grips.
3. **Weeks 5+:** Begin **Mound Bullpens**. Start with 15–20 pitches and increase the count by 5–10 each week until you reach your game target.

## 💡 Expert Notes

* **Hydration:** Drink half your body weight in ounces of water daily.
* **Pain vs. Soreness:** Muscle soreness is okay. Sharp pain in the elbow or front of the shoulder means **STOP** and rest.
* **Consistency:** It is better to do a 20-minute workout every day than a 2-hour workout once a week.
