Yeah, I gave myself 15 mins to write this first bit. I am a story as old as time so not going too much further there. I need to get some sh!t done and this is a way for me to put that fire to my feet. Put it out into the tiniest little cracked corner of the inner-nets under a decade's worth of piled dust that was always just barely missed when the floor was swept.

Yeah, that'll do it. That'll make my productivity skyrocket. Motivate me to do that thing echoing my brain that gets more lost as the cave loses light.

But seriously, I'm curious, so I ask, what is this sh!t?.

Bon Voyage.
